## Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Then, run:

```console
yarn install
```

## Analytics Tracking

This template includes [Umami](https://umami.is) analytics integration. To enable tracking:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
2. Add your Umami credentials:
   ```bash
   UMAMI_WEB_ID=your_website_id
   UMAMI_WEB_DOMAIN=your_umami_instance_domain
   ```
3. The tracking script will automatically be included in production builds.

## Local Development

To start a local development server, run:

```console
yarn start
```

This command opens a browser window, and most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

To generate static content into the `build` directory, run:

```console
yarn build
```

This can be served using any static content hosting service.

## Deployment

To deploy the website, run:

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

**Required for Production:**
- Ensure Umami environment variables are set in your hosting platform.
- Verify the [Umami plugin configuration](docusaurus.config.js) matches your instance settings.

If you are using GitHub Pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
